<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the recipe my Grandmother would make every year during the holidays. I found the recipe tucked in her Bible when she passed, and it was written in her Grandmother's handwriting. It's been in my family for at least 7 generations, and in 2012, I
    won a Blue Ribbon at the Kentucky State fair by following her exact instructions. Tastes like pure love!
